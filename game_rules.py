  "Cards": '''Each card has a value. Cards from '2' to '9' has the value of the card itself. Cards '10', 'J', 'Q' and 'K' are equivalent to 10. The 'A' is equivalent to 1 or 11. The most powerful set of 2 cards in the game is the 'A' together with another card whose value is 10, which is called Blackjack, as the sum equals 21 and therefore whoever has these two cards in his hands, he wins, unless his opponent also has them in his hands.''',
  "Game": '''Blackjack is a casino game that consists of beating the dealer. Initially, all players start the round with two cards, which are placed face up on the table, except the dealer's last card, which is turned face down. Next, players may want to 'hit' (draw another card) or 'stand' (to continue with the same hand). After everyone has decided to stand, the dealer turns over his second card. If the dealer has a score lower than 17, he must be dealt more cards, up to a total of 5 or if he gets a score higher than 17. You will beat the dealer when you have cards in your hand whose sum of their values ​​exceeds the sum of the dealer's card values, but without exceeding the limit of 21, or if only the dealer exceeds the limit of 21. If both exceed the limit of 21, you lose the round.'''
